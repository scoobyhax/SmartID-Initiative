# SmartID-Initiative
A simple and effective means to obtain a legal form of (state) Identification. SmartID does NOT involve driving records, birth records, or criminal records.  Ideally, SmartID could be used at specific locations that offer services for people without permanent residency or addresses (homeless or otherwise).
